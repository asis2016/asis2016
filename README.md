# About Ashish

Ashish S. Maharjan is working as a Cyber Security Consultant at PwC and is the author of www.amaharjan.de.

In his nonexistent leisure time, he wanders around with his trusty companion ([Tux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot))), in a chaotic Python laboratory, mostly unsure what he's up to.
